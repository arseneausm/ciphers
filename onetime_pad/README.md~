### Onetime Pad Encoder/Decoder

This python script enables the user to encrypt and decrypt text messages with a one-time pad. 

*Usage*

In order to encrypt a file, type:

`py otp.py -e path/to/message.txt path/to/key.txt path/to/output.txt`

In order to decrypt a file, type:

`py otp.py -d path/to/message.txt path/to/key.txt path/to/output.txt`

*Note:* This script should not be used to encrypt anything of value. It wasn't written by a professional, and should not be assumed to be uncrackable (or even work, really).
